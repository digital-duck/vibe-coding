# 30-Second Pitch Video Script

**Talk:** Vibe Coding Works, Is It Maintainable?
**Speaker:** Wen Gong
**Target length:** 30 seconds (~75 words spoken at 150 wpm)

---

## Script (Primary — honest practitioner)

> Vibe coding solves speed. I've been doing it since GPT-3 in 2022.
> But four years in, enterprise maintainability is still an open question —
> and industry leaders agree.
>
> I've shipped two production agents with Claude Code:
> one that upgrades Node.js across hundreds of repos, unattended;
> one that generates any document from any source, at enterprise scale.
>
> Come to my talk for the honest story —
> what worked, what didn't, and five techniques you can use Monday.

## Script (Alternate — question hook)

> Here's a question I've been sitting with for four years:
> AI makes us fast. Does it make our code maintainable?
>
> I've shipped two production agents with Claude Code to find out —
> a Node.js upgrade pipeline across hundreds of repos,
> and a document generation agent serving 5,000 engineers.
>
> Come hear what I learned —
> including five concrete ways to close the gap between prototype and production.

## Delivery Notes

- **Pace:** Measured — ~75 words is comfortable at 150 wpm in 30 sec. Don't rush.
- **Pause:** Brief pause after *"industry leaders agree"* — let the weight of that land.
- **Emphasis words:** `four years` / `still an open question` / `five techniques you can use Monday`
- **Tone:** Honest practitioner, not a hype talk. The credibility is in the admission that it's unsolved.
- **Visual suggestion:** Split screen — fast prototype on one side, messy unmaintainable code on the other. Or simply: a terminal + a question mark.
